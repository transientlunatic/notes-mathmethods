Notes on Mathematical Methods for Physics
=========================================

These are my notes on mathematical methods for physics.
They are mostly derived from the notes which I took during undergraduate courses at the University of Glasgow, but they've been added to here and there with other bits and pieces of information.

You're welcome to use these notes, but they may contain errors, so proceed with caution, and note that here (may) be dragons.
If you do find an error, however, I'd be happy to receive bug reports, suggestions, and the like through Github (the repository storing these
notes can be found at
