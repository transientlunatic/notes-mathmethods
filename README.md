# Notes on Gravitation and General Relativity

These are my notes on gravitation and general relativity. They are
mostly derived from the notes which I took during an undergraduate
course at the University of Glasgow, taught by Dr Norman Gray and Prof
Martin Hendry, but they've been added to here and there with other
bits and pieces of information.

You're welcome to use these notes, but they may contain errors, so
proceed with caution, and note that here (may) be dragons. If you do
find an error, however, I'd be happy to receive bug reports,
suggestions, and the like through Github (the repository storing these
notes can be found at
https://github.com/transientlunatic/notes-gravitation). 

Right now you're welcome to use these notes under the terms of the
CC-NC-ND 4.0 license.

## Compiling these notes

To add awkwardness to inconvenience, these notes need a few unusual
packages to build without modification; these are:

* (momento)[https://github.com/transientlunatic/momento]---  A document class I wrote for taking notes.
* (physicsplus)[https://github.com/transientlunatic/physicsplus] --- A package which contains macros which are useful for physics.

At some point in the future I'm likely to want to change these notes
to use less complicated macros (they make producing HTML versions a
real pain), but for now you'll need to make sure that both of these
are available in your LaTeX installation's search path.
